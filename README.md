# End-to-End Testing of Web Applications

This exercise is based on the TodoMVC example of Playwright, which is based on [tastejs/todomvc](https://todomvc.com/).

## Installation

1. Fork the repository to add it to your account, so you can make your own changes.

2. Install the npm dependencies of the project (actually only `@playwright/test`)

    ```
    cd playwright
    npm install
    ```

3. Install browsers for running tests. Playwright downloads all browsers seperately (eg. to the `AppData` folder).

    ```
    npx playwright install
    ```

4. Verify your installation. You should see your installed version, `v1.38.0` or `v1.39.0`.

    ```
    npx playwright -V
    ```

5. If you use VS Code, you can install the `Playwright Test for VS Code` extension.

**Thats it! You are ready to starting testing!**
Continue with the next page of the course to dive in.


### Setup for new projects

For new projects, Playwright can be initialized with the command below. For this exercise, the project is set up already, so you dont have to.

```
npm init playwright@latest
```
This will create a `playwright.config.ts` file with your settings, install the necessary browsers (optional) and add a Github Actions workflow (optional).

You can modify the playwright config file to your needs and add projects for testing on different platforms.
